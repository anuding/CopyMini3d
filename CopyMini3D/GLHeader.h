// About OpenGL function loaders: modern OpenGL doesn't have a standard header file and requires individual function pointers to be loaded manually.
// Helper libraries are often used for this purpose! Here we are supporting a few common ones: gl3w, glew, glad.
// You may use another loader/header of your choice (glext, glLoadGen, etc.), or chose to manually implement your own.

#include <glad/glad.h>  // Initialize with gladLoadGL()
// Include glfw3.h after our OpenGL definitions
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>
#include <stdio.h>
// [Win32] Our example includes a copy of glfw3.lib pre-compiled with VS2010 to maximize ease of testing and compatibility with old VS compilers.
// To link with VS2010-era libraries, VS2015+ requires linking with legacy_stdio_definitions.lib, which we do using this pragma.
// Your own project should not be affected, as you are likely to link with a newer binary of GLFW that is adequate for your version of Visual Studio.
